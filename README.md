# Route-Generator
This project is being created around Roermond city in order to increase the city's popularity and attract tourists. As a result, a website framework has been built that supports it with integrated navigation with top picks of attractions, nightlife, cultural destinations, and cuisine options. Each category has its own location and is linked to a route that is pre-generated based on the selection. Despite this, data is collected based on the web platform's approximate work for three months and analysed on a dashboard. The project is based on a fictitious circumstance, and it was created as a prototype that will not be utilised in everyday life.
